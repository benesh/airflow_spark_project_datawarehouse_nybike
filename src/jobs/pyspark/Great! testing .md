Great! Let's help you implement testing in your workflow. Here's a step-by-step guide:

---

### 1. **Add Testing Functions**
   - Create helper functions for testing row counts and non-null columns.

   ```python
   def test_number_of_rows(spark, df, expected_rows):
       assert len(df) == expected_rows, f"Expected {expected_rows} rows but got {len(df)}"

   def test_non_null_columns(df, columns_to_check=None):
       for column in columns_to_check or df.columns:
           na_count = spark.rownr(df[column].naof())
           if na_count > 0:
               raise AssertionError(f"Column {column} has null values")
       return True

   def test_data_integrity(spark, source_df, target_df):
       # Check if the number of rows is consistent
       assert len(source_df) == len(target_df), "Row counts do not match"

       # Optional: Add more checks based on your requirements
       return True
   ```

---

### 2. **Modify Your Code**
   - Add these tests to your `run` function.

```python
def run(spark, source_config, target_config):
    # Load data from source
    df = spark.read.copy().format(...).load()

    # Run queries and assert results
    result_df = df.createTempView("temp_df")
    query_result = spark.sql(f"""
        SELECT COUNT(*) as row_count
        FROM {result_df}
    """)

    # Test row count
    test_number_of_rows(spark, result_df, expected_rows=10)

    # Optional: Test non-null columns or data integrity

    if target_config['write_enabled']:
        # Write to target
        spark.write.format(...).save()

    return True
```

---

### 3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - If you want to keep testing within the same job:
     - Use `assert` statements to fail the job if tests fail.
     - Ensure that all critical checks are included in your workflow.

   - If you prefer a separate testing job:
     - Create a testing configuration with a smaller dataset or subset of data.
     - Run the same tests using your `test_number_of_rows` and `test_non_null_columns` functions.

---

### 4. **When to Use Each Approach**
   - **In-Workflow Testing:**
     - Best for simple checks (e.g., row counts, column presence).
     - Requires minimal code changes.
     - Runs as part of the main workflow.

   - **Separate Testing Job:**
     - Better for complex or comprehensive testing.
     - Allows you to run tests independently without affecting production data.
     - Useful if you want to test multiple scenarios or configurations.

---

### 5. **Potential Challenges**
   - If you use in-workflow testing, ensure that any errors during testing do not block the workflow entirely (use
`ignore` where appropriate).
   - If you use a separate testing job, ensure that it runs quickly and does not consume unnecessary resources.
